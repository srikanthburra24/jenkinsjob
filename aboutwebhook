-Webhooks allow you to build or set up integrations, such as GitHub Apps or OAuth Apps, which subscribe to certain events on GitHub.com. 
-When one of those events is triggered, we'll send a HTTP POST payload to the webhook's configured URL. 
-Webhooks can be installed on an organization, a specific repository, or a GitHub App. Once installed, the webhook will be sent each time one or more   subscribed events occurs.
-Can create up to 20 webhooks for each event on each installation target (specific organization or specific repository).
-When configuring a webhook, you can use the UI or API to choose which events will send you payloads. 
-A webhook is an HTTP callback, an HTTP POST that occurs when something happens through a simple event-notification via HTTP POST.
-GitHub webhooks in Jenkins are used to trigger the build whenever a developer commits something to the master/main branch.
