-Webhooks allow you to build or set up integrations, such as GitHub Apps or OAuth Apps, which subscribe to certain events on GitHub.com. 
-When one of those events is triggered, we'll send a HTTP POST payload to the webhook's configured URL. 
-Webhooks can be installed on an organization, a specific repository, or a GitHub App. Once installed, the webhook will be sent each time one or more   subscribed events occurs.
-Can create up to 20 webhooks for each event on each installation target (specific organization or specific repository).
-When configuring a webhook, you can use the UI or API to choose which events will send you payloads. 
-A webhook is an HTTP callback, an HTTP POST that occurs when something happens through a simple event-notification via HTTP POST.
-GitHub webhooks in Jenkins are used to trigger the build whenever a developer commits something to the master/main branch.

A webhook is a lightweight API that powers one-way data sharing triggered by events. Together, they enable applications to share data and functionality, and turn the web into something greater than the sum of its parts. APIs and webhooks both allow different software systems to sync up and share information.
